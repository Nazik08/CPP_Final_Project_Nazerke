The game is a simple console-based runner featuring a dinosaur character that jumps to avoid moving cacti obstacles. The player presses the spacebar to make the dinosaur leap while the obstacles continually scroll from right to left. If the dinosaur collides with a cactus, a "Game Over!" message appears. The game uses text-based graphics, with the dinosaur represented by ðŸ¦– and the cacti by ðŸŒµ, creating an engaging yet straightforward gameplay experience.
